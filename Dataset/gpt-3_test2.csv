Or, the two bicameral branches of legislation. Or practically any history before Madonna or Ms. Gaga. My mother only attended and was graduated from high school after only three years (she skipped twice) and took a course in basic civics... She knew far more than my undergraduate students at CUNY. So, kids who (if) they vote are basing their decisions with no knolwledge. Not to mention the sophisticated understanding that is required to understand this complex world.

Employers pay people as if they're worth nothing, but force them to sign non-compete contracts because they might have the know-how to ruin the company's business. If that isn't worth something, what is? Maybe those small business owners should find better ways to encourage people not to walk off with trade secrets, like treating underlings with respect, paying a living wage, and sharing the profits.

7313,7313,"I personally believe that whatever the outcome of the civil war, the one outcome which would lead to a much wider and more destructive war would be a true victory by Assad's forces which would empower Hezbollah and project Iranian power through its erstwhile clients to the shores of the Mediterranean. This is a truly regionally destabilizing possibility which would present many powers in the area with difficult potentially war causing choices. That fear draws ample support from the powers that most fear that outcome and it tends to place those resources in the hands of the most destabilizing forces in the opposition which include the most militant of islamists and those bearing the greatest ressentinent against Shiites and minority groups in Syria. The only way to stanch that flow of resources is to at least supply the most acceptable opposition forces and to marginalize the more dangerous opposition actors. What all this means is that intervention is inevitable and that the cost and complexity of intervention only increases with time. Our response to this crisis will be studied for decades as the primary example of how nonintervention bears the same if not greater human costs as intervention.",potential wider war,0
