All private business in Russia was illegal under communism, so when communism fell, the first and strongest entrants were people from criminal backgrounds who had already been engaging in it illegally. They have not yet lost control; not enough time has passed. Similarly, because prostitution has been illegal in many places, even where it has become legal, there is a tendency for it to initially be dominated by the sometimes violent pimps who prevailed when it was illegal. As time passes, in large areas where it is fully legal, it will become less dominated by the criminal element and less violent (although it will never cease to be unpleasant in other ways).": {"Violence in sex industry": "disagree", "Role of criminality in prostitution": "agree", "Impact of legalizing prostitution": "agree"}, "Red Aurebach was asked about raising the rim to neutralize some of the putative advantage held by taller players. He said, I think correctly, that raising the rim would increase that advantage, not decrease it. Are you advocating raising the rim only in the NBA? Should Division I programs also follow suit. Surely high school players would not want the rim raised, many of them short and land locked. And how many players in the NBA cannot dunk? Nobody would be my guess. You want to neutralize the advantage of taller player? Box out. You want to bring back the mid range jumper? Get rid of the 3 point shot.
