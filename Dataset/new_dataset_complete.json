Like Ioannidis said we have an epidemic of opinions in medicine today. Some studies have shown that education in opioids improves care. There is also studies showing education on pain care improves pain care. Education on opioids will miss the mark, in my opinion, if the goal is to improve pain care and prevent addiction to opioids. It is clear doctors do not wish to have education in either pain care or on opioids- as statements by the AMA and aafp and efforts by the MSSNY are indicative of. But being a doctor is not a god given right and society has the right to dictate to those who want to be doctors what education they need to obtain and maintain their license.

Enlightenment is the turning away from self-interest to the larger self, that is, social consciousness and class war is not so much between the haves and have-nots in the financial sense as between the developed and the undeveloped in social consciousness. Such development is typically resisted as the growth of self necessarily invokes a sense of responsibility larger than the self; that is, altruism is seen as a perilous loss of self. Thus, in growth, the self appears exposed, vulnerable and at risk. But as healthcare joins medicare, food stamps, un-employment compensation, social security, the FDIC and soon to be measures to end consumer ripoffs and every sort of unethical capitalism, those who have opposed these measures will be seen to be lacking in common sense.

I won't waste my time reading the rest. \"Excessive dog breeding, ear cropping and tail docking are more abusive than declawing a pet cat\". Clearly the author doesn't understand what goes on in a declaw surgery. They're amputating the toe completely so the cat has to walk on the phlanges that are NOT meant to be completely weight-bearing. A dog getting its ears or tail docked I agree is cruel but nowhere near worse than a cat being declawed. Last time I checked a dog's tail and ears aren't what bear all of their body weight when standing. Not to mention the ears are soft tissue that heals over time and has nothing to do with the dog's skeleton. The tail does involve the skeleton but would not have an effect on the dog's overall well-being once done. And excessive dog breeding? That has nothing to do with surgical procedures done on a dog or cat. That's a completely separate issue altogether.
